# qr_code_reader

A demo project made as part of my upskilling with Flutter.
The app is able to scan QR codes and have the data from the QR code stored in shared preferences to be displayed to the user.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Building the app

If you are running the app on iOS you will need to select a Development Team in the `Signings & Capabilities` for the `Runner` target

Afterwards you can then run
`flutter build [platform] --[build configuration]`

## Running the app

Make sure you either have an emulator running or a physical device connected to your computer then run:
`flutter run --[build configuration]`
